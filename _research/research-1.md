title: "Regulatory determinants of procyclicality in bank lending activity"
excerpt: "We examine how bank specific determinants and institutional factors affect the procyclicality of loan loss provisions and the association between bank lending and bank capital. We also explain whether bank lending, bank capital and loan loss provisions are empirically related by checking if lending of banks, whose loan loss provisions are more procyclical or who do not apply income smoothing, is more capital constrained during recessionary periods.
