title: "Bank-type specific determinants of sensitivity of loan-loss provisions to business cycle"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this paper, we explore several new factors which may affect the procyclicality of loan-loss provisions in all commercial and cooperative banks operating in Poland between 2000 and 2012. More specifically, we test whether there are visible differences between commercial and cooperative banks in the sensitivity of those provisions to the business cycle. Our results show that whereas loan-loss provisions are procyclical in both cases, the procyclicality is particularly prominent and stronger in the case of commercial banks, than of the cooperative banks.'
