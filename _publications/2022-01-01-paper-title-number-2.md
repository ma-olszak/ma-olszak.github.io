title: "Does bank competition matter for the effects of macroprudential policy on the procyclicality of lending?"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'Despite the extensive debate on the impact of bank competition on risk-taking and procyclicality, there is no evidence of its role in the effects of macroprudential policy on loan growth and on the sensitivity of lending to the business cycle. Using over 80,000 bank-level observations in 95 countries from 2004 to 2015, we find that increased competition strengthens the countercyclical effects of macroprudential policy instruments (MPIs) in terms of reduced loan growth.'
